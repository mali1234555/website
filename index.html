        <h3>Origin</h2>
    </center>
    <img src="Images\nepali-farmer-family-hari-prasad-sharma.jpg" alt="Newars" class="painting">
    <p class="third">The earliest known history of the Newar and Kathmandu Valley is mixed with myths recorded in
        historical chronicles. One such text that tells the formation of the valley is Swayambpurana. According
        to this Buddhist scripture, the Valley of Kathmandu was a vast lake until Bodhisattva Manjushri, with the
        help of the Holy Sword, cut through the gaps in the surrounding hills and drained water. Backed by
        geological evidence of the ancient lake bottom, this apocalyptic legend explains the high fertility of
        the soil in the Kathmandu Valley.</p>
    <img src="Images\hari-prasad-sharma-painting-3.jpg" alt="Newari People" class="painting2">
    <p class="fourth">According to Swayamb Prana, the Manjushri later established a city called the Manjushri.
        Sanskrit for "land founded by the Manjushri”, now called the Manjushri, and Dharmakara. I made it a king.
        Magiper has another shrine dedicated to Manjushri. From this era until the arrival of the Gopal era, no
        historical documents were found. The genealogy of the king is recorded in a chronicle called Gopalara
        javamsavali. According to this manuscript, King Gopal was taken over by Mahispar and Kirat before the
        Licchavi royal invasion from the south. Some claim that the Buddha visited Nepal during the reign of King
        Kirat Zitedusti. The Richavi dynasty ruled for at least 600 years, followed by the Malla dynasty in the
        12th century.</p>

    <p class="fifth">Although "Nepal Basa" is classified as Sino-Tibetan, many of its grammars, words and
        vocabularies are derived from the influence of South Indian languages ​​such as Sanskrit, Prakrit and
        Maithili. The Newar are connected by a common language and culture.Their common language is Nepal Bhasa or
        the linguistic progenitor of that language. Nepal Bhasa is the term recognized by the government.</p>
    <p class="sixth">Newar Basa is a language that was spoken as early as the Richavi era and is believed to have
        evolved from the language spoken in Nepal during the Kirat era. The Nepal Basa inscription appeared in the
        12th century, the first example being a manuscript of Ukubaha palm leaves. Nepalese Basa developed as a
        court and official language in the 14th and late 18th centuries. It has been universally used in stone and
        bronze inscriptions, sacred manuscripts, official documents, diaries, diplomas, correspondence, and
        creative writing.</p>
