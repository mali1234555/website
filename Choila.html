    <center><h2>Choila</h2></center>
    <img src="Images\IMG_20210514_202808.jpg" alt="Choila" class="choila"><p class="choila1">Choila, sometimes Chhwela or Chhoyela (Nepal: छोइला), is a typical New Ali dish consisting of spiced grilled buffalo meat. This dish has traditionally been popular with  buffalo meat, but more recently mutton, chicken, duck and mushrooms have also been used. This dish is usually eaten with rice flakes (chiura) and is usually very spicy, hot and tasty. It is considered a necessary part of the diet at festivals in the Newar community, along with some other ingredients. It is also an important part of Samay Baji. There are 2 types of Choila: 1. Haku Choila 2. Mana Choila</p>
    <center><h3>Haku Choila</h3></center><img src="Images\Buff chhoila.jpg" alt="Haku Choila" class="haku"><p class="haku1">Haku Choila is prepared by roasting the meat in the hay fire; this is the traditional way of making choila. It is traditionally popular with buff meat and the method fills the meat with tangy smoky flavors. This is the original way of making Newari Choila.</p><p class="haku2">Traditionally,  meat is cooked on the fire, but at home it can be grilled because of its smoky flavor. Served with rice, whiprice and drinks. It is one of the important side dishes of the Samaya Baji set. It's usually very spicy and spicy, but you can also taste it with chili powder.</p>
    <center><h3>Mana Choila</h3></center><img src="Images\277921485_1576712116018691_8335367205876119106_n.png" alt="Mana Choila" class="choila"><p class="haku1">Technically, manchoila is not choila. The term choira is an abbreviation for the term "chuyata agra" which means "fried meat". Manchoira, on the other hand, is boiled rather than roasted. So why was the boiled meat dish named after the fried meat dish? It's arguable, but  the deliciousness of this dish cannot be denied.</p><p class="haku2">This tender, flavorful and juicy meat dish is one of the most common Newar meat dishes  and  can be found almost anywhere. The reason for its popularity may be that the recipe  is really easy to make and has a real Newar feel, even though it is not made by Newar.</p>
