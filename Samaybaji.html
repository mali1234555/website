In recent years, this food has become one of the main attractions in Nepal. It is considered to be a typical dish of the Newar people in Nepal. This dish has been passed down for generations and is still highly regarded by people. There is no specific time when this dish will be served, but most of the time it will be served on auspicious occasions at family reunions and Newar festivals. Samay Baji is treated as an appetizer at all festivals, religious activities and pujas. It is also offered in Sharada (death anniversary ritual). Due to its simplicity, it is used all year round. It is easy to make and has a long shelf life.</p></div>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <img src="Images\samay-baji-traditional.jpg" alt="Samaybaji" class="samaybaji2"><p class="samaybaji3">The Newar had merchants, priests, goldsmiths, and blacksmiths. But in the old days, most of them were farmers. They followed the four seasons, which also influenced their habits and lifestyle. At that time, there was no electricity or gas as it is today. The source of the burning fire was a log. Burning firewood is a tedious and time-consuming task. For this reason, we cooked twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Therefore,  the whole family will eat a morning meal shortly after sunrise before going out to work on the farm. At that time, there was no concept of breakfast  in Nepal. The Newars once lived in a closed society, so their homes and huts were built next to each other.</p>
